# Empathetic_Play
This is a prototype game aimed at increasing empathy in youth towards cyberbullying. You can find the PDF of my SITE presentation as well as the web version of the game. 

In order to play:
1) Download the Empathetic_Play.zip file.
2) Unzip and open the index.html file in your favorite browser.
3) If the game does not load, try a different browser such as Microsoft Edge or Firefox.
4) If you still cannot get the game to load, contact Matt Nowatzke at mnowatz@iastate.edu and I'll get you a different version.
